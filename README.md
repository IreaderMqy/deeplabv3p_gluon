# deeplabv3p_gluon
DeepLab v3+ in MXNet Gluon

# Note
* `workspace`: the notebooks I did experiments, with messy staff.
* `mylib`: the well organized "lib-style" code.
* GPU version only, but it should be modified easily into a CPU version.
* My running environments:
    * Python==3.6
    * TensorFlow==1.4.0
    * Keras==2.1.5
    * MXNet==1.2.0
